# Unified Trash System Implementation - COMPLETE! ✅

**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Build Status:** ✅ Successful

---

## 🎉 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

The unified trash system has been successfully implemented! All deleted items are now logged to a single `deleted_items` table, enabling restore functionality and better organization.

---

## 📊 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Database Schema** ✅

**New Table: `deleted_items`**

```sql
CREATE TABLE deleted_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (table_name IN ('transactions', 'categories', 'budgets')),
  record_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  record_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  deletion_reason TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes Created:**
- `idx_deleted_items_user_id` - Fast user queries
- `idx_deleted_items_table_name` - Filter by table
- `idx_deleted_items_deleted_at` - Sort by deletion date
- `idx_deleted_items_record_id` - Find specific records
- `idx_deleted_items_composite` - Optimized for common queries

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can view own deleted items
- Users can insert own deleted items
- Users can delete own deleted items (for permanent deletion)

---

### **2. API Routes Updated** ✅

#### **DELETE Endpoints (3 files updated):**

1. **`src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts`**
   - Fetches full transaction before deletion
   - Logs to `deleted_items` table
   - Performs soft delete (sets `deleted_at`)

2. **`src/app/api/categories/[id]/route.ts`**
   - Checks for active transactions (not deleted ones)
   - Fetches full category before deletion
   - Logs to `deleted_items` table
   - Performs soft delete (sets `deleted_at`)

3. **`src/app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts`**
   - Fixed imports to use new auth pattern
   - Fetches full budget before deletion
   - Logs to `deleted_items` table
   - Performs soft delete (sets `deleted_at`)

#### **New Trash API Routes (2 files created):**

1. **`src/app/api/trash/route.ts`** - List all deleted items
   - GET `/api/trash` - Get all deleted items
   - Optional `?table=transactions` filter
   - Returns grouped data by table type
   - Returns total count

2. **`src/app/api/trash/[id]/route.ts`** - Manage individual deleted items
   - GET `/api/trash/[id]` - Get specific deleted item
   - PUT `/api/trash/[id]` - Restore deleted item
   - DELETE `/api/trash/[id]` - Permanently delete item

---

### **3. React Query Hooks** ✅

**New File: `src/hooks/use-trash.ts`**

**Hooks Created:**
- `useDeletedItems(table?)` - Fetch all deleted items (optionally filtered by table)
- `useDeletedItem(id)` - Fetch specific deleted item
- `useRestoreItem()` - Restore a deleted item
- `usePermanentlyDeleteItem()` - Permanently delete an item

**Features:**
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Optimistic updates support
- Error handling built-in

---

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Deletion Flow:**

```
User clicks "Delete" button
  ↓
1. API fetches full record from original table
  ↓
2. API inserts record into deleted_items table
   - table_name: 'transactions' | 'categories' | 'budgets'
   - record_id: UUID of deleted record
   - record_data: Full JSONB of the record
   - deleted_at: Current timestamp
  ↓
3. API sets deleted_at in original table (soft delete)
  ↓
4. RLS policies hide record from user
  ↓
Record appears "deleted" but is fully recoverable!
```

### **Restore Flow:**

```
User clicks "Restore" button in Trash Bin
  ↓
1. API fetches deleted item from deleted_items table
  ↓
2. API sets deleted_at = NULL in original table
  ↓
3. API removes entry from deleted_items table
  ↓
4. RLS policies show record again
  ↓
Record is restored and visible to user!
```

### **Permanent Delete Flow:**

```
User clicks "Permanently Delete" button
  ↓
1. API fetches deleted item from deleted_items table
  ↓
2. API performs hard delete from original table
  ↓
3. API removes entry from deleted_items table
  ↓
Record is permanently removed from database!
```

## 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

### **Database (1 migration):**
✅ `create_deleted_items_table` - Created unified trash table

### **API Routes (5 files):**
✅ `src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts` - Updated DELETE to log deletions  
✅ `src/app/api/categories/[id]/route.ts` - Updated DELETE to log deletions  
✅ `src/app/api/budgets/[id]/route.ts` - Updated DELETE to log deletions  
✅ `src/app/api/trash/route.ts` - NEW: List deleted items  
✅ `src/app/api/trash/[id]/route.ts` - NEW: Restore/permanently delete  

### **Hooks (1 file):**

## 🎯 **Current State**

### **What's Working:**
✅ All deletions are logged to `deleted_items` table  
✅ Soft delete still works (deleted_at column)  
✅ API endpoints for restore and permanent delete  
✅ React Query hooks ready to use  
✅ Type-safe TypeScript implementation  
✅ RLS policies protect user data  
✅ Build successful (no errors)  

### **What's Next (UI Implementation):**
- [ ] Create Trash Bin page (`/trash`)
- [ ] Display deleted items grouped by type
- [ ] Add restore button for each item
- [ ] Add permanent delete button
- [ ] Add "Empty Trash" button (delete all)
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality
- [ ] Add auto-cleanup after 30 days (optional)

## 🚀 **Next Steps: Building the Trash Bin UI**

### **Phase 1: Create Trash Page** (30 minutes)

1. Create `/trash` page:
```typescript
// src/app/(dashboard)/trash/page.tsx
import { TrashBinContent } from '@/components/trash/trash-bin-content'

export default function TrashPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Trash Bin</h1>
      <TrashBinContent />
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. Create TrashBinContent component:
```typescript
// src/components/trash/trash-bin-content.tsx
'use client'

import { useDeletedItems, useRestoreItem, usePermanentlyDeleteItem } from '@/hooks/use-trash'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { toast } from '@/components/ui/toast'

export function TrashBinContent() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useDeletedItems()
  const restoreItem = useRestoreItem()
  const permanentlyDelete = usePermanentlyDeleteItem()

  const handleRestore = async (id: string) => {
    try {
      await restoreItem.mutateAsync(id)
      toast.success({ title: 'Item restored successfully' })
    } catch (error: any) {
      toast.error({ title: 'Failed to restore item', description: error.message })
    }
  }

  const handlePermanentDelete = async (id: string) => {
    try {
      await permanentlyDelete.mutateAsync(id)
      toast.success({ title: 'Item permanently deleted' })
    } catch (error: any) {
      toast.error({ title: 'Failed to delete item', description: error.message })
    }
  }

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Transactions */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Deleted Transactions</h2>
        {data?.grouped.transactions.map(item => (
          <div key={item.id} className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 border rounded">
            <div>
              <p className="font-medium">{item.record_data.description}</p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                Deleted: {new Date(item.deleted_at).toLocaleDateString()}
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="space-x-2">
              <Button onClick={() => handleRestore(item.id)}>Restore</Button>
              <Button variant="destructive" onClick={() => handlePermanentDelete(item.id)}>
                Delete Forever
              </Button>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>

      {/* Categories */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Deleted Categories</h2>
        {/* Similar structure */}
      </section>

      {/* Budgets */}
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Deleted Budgets</h2>
        {/* Similar structure */}
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```
