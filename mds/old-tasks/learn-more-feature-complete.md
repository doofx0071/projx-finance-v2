---

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. InsightCard Component** (`src/components/insights/insight-card.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `onLearnMore` callback prop
- Connected "Learn More" button to callback
- Button triggers when clicked

**Code Added:**
```tsx
interface InsightCardProps {
  insight: FinancialInsight
  onLearnMore?: (insight: FinancialInsight) => void  // NEW
}

// In button:
<Button 
  size="sm" 
  variant="outline" 
  className="cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => onLearnMore?.(insight)}  // NEW
>
  Learn More
</Button>
```

### **2. FinancialChatbot Component** (`src/components/financial-chatbot.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `initialMessage` prop to accept pre-filled messages
- Added `onOpen` callback prop
- Auto-fills input when `initialMessage` is provided
- Auto-focuses input so user can see the message

**Code Added:**
```tsx
interface FinancialChatbotProps {
  initialMessage?: string  // NEW
  onOpen?: () => void      // NEW
}

export function FinancialChatbot({ initialMessage, onOpen }: FinancialChatbotProps = {}) {
  // Handle initial message when provided
  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialMessage && isOpen && !isLoading) {
      setInput(initialMessage)
      if (inputRef.current) {
        inputRef.current.focus()
      }
    }
  }, [initialMessage, isOpen, isLoading])
}
```

### **3. Insights Page** (`src/app/(dashboard)/insights/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `chatbotMessage` state for pre-filled message
- Added `chatbotKey` state to force chatbot re-render
- Created `handleLearnMore` function to generate contextual questions
- Passed `onLearnMore` callback to InsightCard components
- Passed `initialMessage` and `key` to FinancialChatbot

**Code Added:**
```tsx
const [chatbotMessage, setChatbotMessage] = useState<string>('')
const [chatbotKey, setChatbotKey] = useState(0)

const handleLearnMore = (insight: FinancialInsight) => {
  // Create a contextual question based on the insight
  const question = `Tell me more about: ${insight.title}. ${insight.description}`
  setChatbotMessage(question)
  // Force chatbot to re-render with new message by changing key
  setChatbotKey(prev => prev + 1)
}

// In rendering:
<InsightCard 
  key={insight.id} 
  insight={insight} 
  onLearnMore={handleLearnMore}  // NEW
/>

<FinancialChatbot 
  key={chatbotKey}                // NEW - forces re-render
  initialMessage={chatbotMessage}  // NEW - pre-fills message
/>
```
